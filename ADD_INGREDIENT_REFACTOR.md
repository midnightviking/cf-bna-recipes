# Add Ingredient Form Refactoring

## Summary
Extracted the "Add Ingredient to Recipe" functionality from `RecipeForm.svelte` into a separate, reusable component to improve code organization and separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### New Component: `AddIngredientForm.svelte`
**Location:** `src/lib/components/recipe_form/AddIngredientForm.svelte`

**Responsibilities:**
- Render the ingredient input form (ingredient, quantity, unit, section)
- Validate user input before adding ingredients
- Add validated ingredients to the recipe's ingredient list
- Reset form state after successful addition
- Access units data from context

**Props (Bindable):**
- `section_list` - Available sections for categorization
- `ingredient_list` - The recipe's ingredient list (mutated when adding)
- `_localIndex` - Counter for unique ingredient identification

**Features:**
- Form validation (checks for required fields and positive quantity)
- Auto-reset after successful addition
- Responsive grid layout (SMUI InnerGrid/Cell)
- Clean, focused UI with proper styling

### Updated: `RecipeForm.svelte`

**Before:**
- 82 lines of inline UI markup for add ingredient form
- Local state variables for form inputs scattered in parent
- Business logic mixed with presentation

**After:**
- Single component reference: `<AddIngredientForm ... />`
- Clean separation: parent manages recipe state, child handles form
- Reduced RecipeForm by ~70 lines

**Key Change:**
```svelte
<!-- Old: 82 lines of inline markup -->
<div class="add-ingredient-row">
  <InnerGrid>
    <!-- ... lots of Cell/Select/Textfield markup ... -->
  </InnerGrid>
</div>

<!-- New: Clean component reference -->
<AddIngredientForm 
  bind:section_list 
  bind:ingredient_list 
  bind:_localIndex 
/>
```

**Additional Fix:**
- Changed `_localIndex` from plain `let` to `$state()` for proper reactivity

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns
- **RecipeForm**: Orchestrates overall recipe editing, manages recipe-level state
- **AddIngredientForm**: Encapsulates ingredient addition UI and validation logic
- Clear responsibility boundaries

### Reusability
- `AddIngredientForm` can potentially be reused in other recipe-related contexts
- Self-contained with minimal dependencies (only needs section_list, ingredient_list, units context)

### Maintainability
- Changes to ingredient addition logic isolated to one component
- Easier to test ingredient addition in isolation
- Reduced cognitive load when reading RecipeForm

### Consistency
- Follows same pattern as other extracted components:
  - `RecipeMetaFields` - recipe metadata
  - `SectionList` - section management
  - `IngredientList` - ingredient display
  - `AlternatesEditor` - alternates management
  - `AddIngredientForm` - ingredient addition (NEW)

## Validation Logic
The component validates:
1. Ingredient is selected (`new_ingredient` is not null)
2. Unit is selected (`new_unit` is not null)
3. Quantity is positive and not null
4. Unit exists in units list

Invalid submissions are silently ignored (returns early).

## State Management
Uses Svelte 5 runes:
- `$state()` for reactive form inputs
- `$bindable()` for two-way binding with parent
- `$props()` for component props

## Testing Recommendations
When testing the recipe form:
1. Try adding ingredients to different sections
2. Verify form resets after successful addition
3. Test validation (try submitting with missing fields)
4. Confirm ingredients appear in correct section
5. Check that _localIndex increments properly

## Future Enhancements
- Add visual feedback for validation errors
- Support keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Enter to add)
- Add autocomplete/search for ingredients
- Display ingredient preview before adding
