## 🎯 What You'll Fix

### Critical Issues (Do First)
1. ❌ **No Input Validation** → Add validation schemas
2. ❌ **No Error Handling** → Add error boundaries + toasts
3. ❌ **No Transactions** → Wrap operations in DB transactions

### Medium Issues (Do Next)
4. ⚠️ **State Management Scattered** → Centralize in store
5. ⚠️ **Duplicate Logic** → Single source of truth
6. ⚠️ **No Type Safety** → Add JSDoc + runtime validation

### Nice-to-Have (Polish)
7. 📝 **No Documentation** → Comprehensive docs
8. 🧪 **No Tests** → >80% test coverage

## 🎬 How to Get Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Path (5 minutes)
```
Do you have 3 hours this week?     → Fast Path (QUICK_WINS.md)
Do you have 1 week?               → Smart Path (Phase 1)
Do you want full solution?        → Complete Path (All phases)
```

### Step 2: Read the Right Document (10-30 min)
- **Fast**: QUICK_WINS.md
- **Smart**: ROADMAP.md + QUICK_WINS.md + CODE_STABILITY_PLAN.md (Phase 1)
- **Complete**: All documents in PLANNING_INDEX.md

### Step 3: Create Your Task Board (10 min)
- Copy tasks from chosen document
- Add to GitHub Projects / Trello / your tool
- Estimate hours for each
- Schedule your calendar time

### Step 4: Start Implementing (Now!)
- Pick task #1
- Copy code from examples
- Test locally: `npm run dev`
- Commit to git
- Move to next task

## 💭 The Bottom Line

### The Problem
Your code works today but is **brittle**. One small production issue could be really hard to debug because there's no error handling, validation, or tests.

### The Solution
Follow the 5-phase plan. It's designed to be done incrementally, with immediate benefits at each step.

### The Time
- Quick wins only: 3 hours
- Safety critical: 1 week
- Complete overhaul: 4-5 weeks

### The Payoff
- Silent failures → prevented
- Data corruption → impossible
- Debugging time → cut by 80%
- Team velocity → increases
- Production confidence → soars

## 📖 One-Paragraph Summary

cf-bna-recipes is a functional recipe management app that needs robustness improvements. There are 7 major fragility points (no validation, no error handling, no transactions, scattered state, duplicate logic, no types, no tests). This plan provides 5 phases to fix them: Phase 1 (validation + errors), Phase 2 (transactions + normalization), Phase 3 (state + testing), Phase 4 (polish), Phase 5 (advanced). You can start today with 6 quick wins (3 hours) or go full-speed with Phase 1 (1 week) or commit to the complete plan (4-5 weeks). Total effort is 76-92 hours. The payoff is a production-ready, testable, maintainable codebase with 20:1 ROI.
