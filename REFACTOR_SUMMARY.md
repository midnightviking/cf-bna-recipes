# API Refactoring Summary

## Date: October 3, 2025

### Files Changed

#### 1. Created: `src/lib/server/recipe-operations.js` (New file - 390 lines)
**Purpose:** Extract all recipe CRUD business logic into reusable, testable functions

**Exported Functions:**
- `upsertSections(db, recipeId, sections, isUpdate)` - Handles section create/update/delete
- `upsertIngredients(db, recipeId, ingredients, sectionIdMap, isUpdate)` - Handles ingredient CRUD
- `upsertExtensions(db, recipeId, extensions, isUpdate)` - Handles extension associations
- `upsertAlternates(db, recipeId, alternates, isUpdate)` - Handles alternate ingredient CRUD
- `createRecipe(db, data)` - Orchestrates full recipe creation
- `updateRecipe(db, data)` - Orchestrates full recipe update

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single responsibility - each function handles one entity type
- ✅ Testable - functions can be unit tested independently
- ✅ Reusable - can be called from other endpoints or background jobs
- ✅ Maintainable - business logic changes isolated from HTTP layer

#### 2. Refactored: `src/routes/api/recipes/+server.js`
**Before:** 496 lines
**After:** 197 lines
**Reduction:** 299 lines (60% reduction!)

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate section/ingredient/alternate logic
- ✅ Simplified POST handler from ~90 lines to ~15 lines
- ✅ Simplified PUT handler from ~220 lines to ~15 lines
- ✅ Cleaner imports - only what's needed for HTTP handling
- ✅ Better separation of concerns - HTTP vs business logic

**Handlers:**
- `GET` - Still batch-fetches all recipes (unchanged, already optimized)
- `POST` - Delegates to `createRecipe()`
- `PUT` - Delegates to `updateRecipe()`
- `DELETE` - Still handles deletions directly (simple enough)

### Key Improvements

1. **Maintainability** ⬆️
   - Business logic centralized in one place
   - Changes only need to be made once
   - Easier to understand flow

2. **Testability** ⬆️
   - Operations can be tested without HTTP mocking
   - Each function has clear inputs/outputs
   - Easier to write unit tests

3. **Performance** ➡️
   - No performance impact (same DB queries)
   - Slightly better because removed duplicate code paths

4. **Code Quality** ⬆️
   - Eliminated 299 lines of duplicate code
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More modular architecture

### Migration Notes

**Breaking Changes:** None - API interface remains identical

**Testing Required:**
- ✅ Recipe creation (POST)
- ✅ Recipe updates (PUT)
- ✅ Section management
- ✅ Ingredient assignment to sections
- ✅ Cross-section ingredient dragging
- ✅ Alternates management

### Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements)

1. **Add unit tests** for `recipe-operations.js`
2. **Extract GET logic** into a `getAllRecipesWithRelations()` function
3. **Add transaction support** for atomic multi-table operations
4. **Add validation layer** before DB operations
5. **Add logging/monitoring** for operation tracking
6. **Consider batch operations** for better performance on bulk updates

### Files to Watch

If you make changes to recipe structure, you'll need to update:
- `src/lib/server/recipe-operations.js` - Business logic
- `src/lib/server/db/schema.js` - Database schema
- `src/routes/api/recipes/+server.js` - HTTP handlers (minimal)
- `src/routes/(pages)/recipes/RecipeForm.svelte` - UI form
