Here’s a clear plan to add draggable, ordered ingredients with sections, using Svelte 5 and your current Drizzle/D1 setup. I’ll outline schema changes, API updates, and UI wiring; no code changes yet.

Checklist
- Add ordered sections support in the DB.
- Persist ingredient ordering and section membership.
- Update API to read/write sections and order.
- Update form UI for sections + drag-and-drop within/between sections.
- Update print and read models to display sections in order.
- Backward compatibility + migration path for existing data.

Recommended design
- Normalize sections into their own table so you can:
  - Name sections (“Soup”, “Dumplings”).
  - Reorder sections.
  - Drag ingredients between sections.
- Keep a numeric order for both sections and ingredients.

Database schema (Drizzle SQLite / Cloudflare D1)
- New table: recipe_sections
  - id: integer PK autoincrement
  - recipe_id: integer not null (FK to recipes)
  - name: text not null
  - ordering: integer not null (default 0)
- Alter table: recipe_ingredients
  - Add column section_id: integer null (FK to recipe_sections.id)
  - Add column ordering: integer not null default 0
- Migration steps:
  - Create recipe_sections.
  - Add section_id and ordering to recipe_ingredients.
  - Backfill existing recipes:
    - Create one section per recipe named “Ingredients” (or leave null to indicate “Unsectioned”).
    - Populate ordering on recipe_ingredients using current index or id asc.
  - Note: For D1, avoid BEGIN/COMMIT. Use standalone statements only.

Files to change (schema and migration)
- schema.js
  - Add recipe_sections table.
  - Add recipe_ingredients.section_id and .ordering.
- `drizzle/0002_sections_and_order.sql` (or similar)
  - CREATE TABLE recipe_sections…
  - ALTER TABLE recipe_ingredients ADD COLUMN section_id…
  - ALTER TABLE recipe_ingredients ADD COLUMN ordering…
  - Optional backfill statements.
- _journal.json snapshot file will be updated by your migration process (no manual edits).

API changes
- Read:
  - recipes.js (getRecipeWithIngredients)
    - Join recipe_sections to get section name and section ordering.
    - Include ingredient ordering.
    - Return an enriched structure:
      - Option A (grouped): { sections: [{ id, name, ordering, ingredients:[{…}] }], …recipe }
      - Option B (flat): Return ingredients with section info; UI groups by section. Suggested: Option A for simpler UI.
    - Sort sections by section.ordering and ingredients by ingredient.ordering.
- Write:
  - +server.js
    - POST:
      - Accept payload: { …, sections: [{id?, name, ordering}], ingredients: [{ ingredient_id, quantity, unit_id, section_id?, ordering }] }
      - If sections contain new (no id), insert them first, capture ids, and map temp ids/names to real ids.
      - Insert ingredients with their ordering and section_id.
    - PUT:
      - Update recipe fields as today.
      - Upsert sections:
        - Delete removed sections for this recipe (optional; or mark removed if you want history).
        - Insert/update existing with ordering.
      - Delete and reinsert recipe_ingredients (as you do now), but include ordering and section_id.
- Optional:
  - Backwards compatibility: Allow ingredients array to include sectionName for simpler clients and resolve to section_id server-side (create section if missing).

Files to change (API)
- recipes.js
- +server.js

UI updates (Svelte 5)
- Authoring form (where you currently add ingredients):
  - RecipeForm.svelte
  - RecipeFormDialog.svelte
  - Add a “Sections” manager:
    - List sections with editable names, add/remove section buttons.
    - Reorder sections via drag handles (pattern like your Cookbook drag).
    - Keep a reactive `$state` array: sections = [{id?, name, ordering}].
  - Ingredients UI:
    - Render per-section containers (droppable).
    - Each container lists its ingredients with drag handles.
    - Support drag within section (reorder) and drag across sections (reassign section_id, set new ordering).
    - Maintain a single source of truth in `$state`:
      - sections: ordered list
      - ingredients: each item with ordering and section_id
    - On save, send sections and ingredients (with ordering, section_id).
- Ingredient selector (already using Autocomplete):
  - No change needed beyond selecting a default section when adding a new ingredient (e.g., currently focused section).
- Accessibility/UX:
  - Use a drag handle button (like CookbookForm) so inputs are clickable without accidental drag.
  - Keyboard reordering with ArrowUp/Down if possible.

Files to change (UI)
- RecipeForm.svelte
- RecipeFormDialog.svelte
- Optionally small changes to:
  - ingredient_select.svelte (default selected section logic)

Printing and display
- RecipePrintTemplate.svelte
  - Update to iterate sections in order and print the section header before its ingredients.
  - Fallback: if no sections, behave like today.
- Menu or other consumers
  - +page.svelte
  - If it expects `recipe.ingredients` flat, either:
    - Keep returning both grouped sections and flat `ingredients` for compatibility, or
    - Update component to handle sections when present.

Quality gates and data flow
- Edge cases:
  - Ingredients with null section_id show under “Unsectioned” or “Ingredients”.
  - When you delete a section, move its ingredients to Unsectioned (or prevent delete if non-empty).
  - Ensure ordering is sequential (0..N-1) per group (sections and per-section ingredients).
- Validation:
  - Ensure section names non-empty.
  - Ensure ordering numbers are integers (server normalizes if needed).
- Performance:
  - Drizzle queries: add joins once, sort in SQL where possible (ORDER BY section ordering, ingredient ordering).

Improved plan refinements
- Why separate sections table? Cleanly supports:
  - Multiple named sections per recipe with their own order.
  - Efficient drag across sections.
  - Future metadata (e.g., section notes).
- Payload simplification option:
  - Accept a compact client payload keyed by section name:
    - sections: [{id?, name, ordering}]
    - ingredients: [{…, sectionName, ordering}]
  - Server resolves/creates section ids. This makes client drag logic simpler if you don’t want to manage ids in the form state.
- Migration safety:
  - Use incremental ALTERs and standalone DDL for D1 (no transactions).
  - Backfill ordering based on existing display order or ids.

Summary of exact files to touch
- Schema/migrations:
  - schema.js
  - `drizzle/0002_sections_and_order.sql` (new)
- Server:
  - recipes.js (grouping and sorting)
  - +server.js (POST/PUT — sections and ingredient ordering)
- UI:
  - RecipeForm.svelte
  - RecipeFormDialog.svelte
  - RecipePrintTemplate.svelte
  - (Optional) +page.svelte if it needs to show sections

If you like this approach, I can implement the schema and API first, then wire the form drag-and-drop with Svelte 5 $state and a drag-handle UX similar to your Cookbook form.
